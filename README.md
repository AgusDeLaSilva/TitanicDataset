# TitanicDataset

Skills: Python, Pandas, GroupBy, DataAnalysis.

In this project we go through the TitanicDataset.

First of all, the csv is read into a DataFrame. Then, it is optimized, renaming some columns and descriptions, droping columns that are not useful and checking if there are duplicated rows. And, lastly, we get some insights from it likeTicket Price Analysis, Survivors Distribution, Survival Probability according buckets (Pclass), names of death people, among others.
